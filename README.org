* ast2hsc
Generate better C FFI bindings by parsing the clang AST dump.

** Usage
#+begin_src bash
  ast2hsc \
      -IdirA -IdirB ... \
      -DMACRO_ONE -DMACRO_TWO ... \
      /path/to/header/file.h
#+end_src

This program is agnostic to all arguments before the last and merely
forwards them to clang, so it will accept more than what's shown in
the above example. The last argument should always be the header file
for which to generate bindings.


** Tutorial
1. Compile C project with clang
2. Get compile_commands.json
3. Get list of headers to generate bindings for
4. Pass in compile_commands.json and the list to the program

   Then, the program:
   1. Generates bindings to whole translation units
   2. Exports the functions in the provided headers
   3. Generates an hsc output
   4. Runs hsc2hs on that hsc output

5. Go adjust the hsc files by hand
6. Run the same command line as before, but with a new flag to only
   run hsc2hs
