* ast2hsc
(WIP) Generate C FFI bindings by parsing the clang AST dump.

** Overview
As it stands, this is just my small effort in automating some of the
work for https://github.com/bradrn/wlhs. The point for the time being
is just to handle the trivial stuff automatically, and keep this tool
as simple as possible.

I figure that, at some point in the future, this could emit proper hsc
files, but for now I'm emitting the bespoke templating language used
in WLHS.

** Usage
#+begin_src bash
  clang -I/path/to/includes \
	-DANY_NECESSARY_DEFINES \
	-x c -Xclang -ast-dump=json -fsyntax-only \
	header_file_to_bind_to.h > header_file_to_bind_to.json
  ast2hsc header_file_to_bind_to.json
#+end_src

** Contributing
If you'd like to help, there's still so much that can be done. In
terms of functionality, supporting nested structs is the biggest
priority. Additionally, any attempt to cleanup my amateurish code is
wholly welcome.
