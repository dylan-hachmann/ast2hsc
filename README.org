* ast2hsc
Generate better C FFI bindings by parsing the clang AST dump.

Usage:
#+begin_src bash
  ast2hsc \
      -IdirA -IdirB ... \
      -DMACRO_ONE -DMACRO_TWO ... \
      /path/to/header/file.h
#+end_src

This program is agnostic to all arguments before the last and merely
forwards them to clang, so it will accept more than what's shown in
the above example. The last argument should always be the header file
for which to generate bindings.
